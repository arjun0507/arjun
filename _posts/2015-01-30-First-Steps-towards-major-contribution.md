title: My first step towards the major contribution
---

EPICS (Engineering Projects in Community Service) and Gear systems has been a major breakthrough in my enginnering life at NIT Warangal.A team of 6 motivated students who had a clear idea of what is going to be their contribution towards the society.And from here my journey began towards something which we believe is going to be a boon not only for the Telangana state but for the whole nation.

After a slow start it was indeed essential that the team had to be into the groove and work towards their assigned targets.Our team leader Sudheesh Singanamalla has provided us with a clear action plan which will rather be fruitful towards the smooth completion of our monthly target.

Preparing Project Financials and cross reviweing them with Sudheesh was my first task which went rather smoothly since we had all the expenses worked out beforehand.

The major responsibilty that i was assigned was setting up the team(Gear system blog) as well as the individual blogs for all team members using BASE 16 Ruby library.This was an interesting as well as a learning experience for me.I came across the various technologies like Jekyll,Ruby,Git,Markdown which i had rarely used before.Sudheesh and Kranthi(one of my teammates) helped me out learning everything and implementing these technologies and now we have all our blog up and running.Even though i was a bit sick during all this time but the motivation towards the project and from my team members helped me complete my first contribution.
